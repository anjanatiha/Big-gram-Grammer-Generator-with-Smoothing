Due Mar. 15, 2018.
1. From the SnapshotBROWN.pos.all.txt file extracted all word types and their frequencies.
2. Sorted the list of word types in decreasing order based on their frequency.
Drew a chart showing the relationship between the rank in the ordered list and the frequency (Zipf's Law). (Do not stem but do ignore punctuation.)
4. Generated a Bigram Grammar from the above file.
5. Performed add-one smoothing. 
6. Showed the grammar before and after smoothing for the sentence "A similar resolution passed in the Senate".
