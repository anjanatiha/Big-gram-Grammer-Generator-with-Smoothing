Sorted the list of word types in decreasing order based on their frequency.
                   Drew a chart showing the relationship between the rank in the ordered list and the frequency (Zipf's Law). 
                   (Do not stem but do ignore punctuation.)
                    Generated a Bigram Grammar from the above file.
